# Client_Server
This program deals with Socket Programming and Multi threading.
In this program I have developed a quiz application where the host asks random questions and any of the clients can choose to answer by clicking the buzzer.
This program has been developed using Python libraries. 
How to operate it and other details are clearly mentioned in the CN_project_Report.pdf
